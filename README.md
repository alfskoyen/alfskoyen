## Hello, welcome. I'm Harold Alfred Haugen :milky_way: :triangular_ruler: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

A transitioned **risk management and audit leader in financial services**, now merging the technical applications of **machine learning and AI** into real-world problem solving.  

Current focus areas include **data structures, feature engineering, A/B testing with linear modeling, feature importance analysis, and outlier recognition**. I apply these methods to challenges in **financial services** and **healthcare analytics**, leveraging 20+ years of experience in risk management alongside a Masterâ€™s in Data Science from UVA.
