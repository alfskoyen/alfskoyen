## :milky_way: :triangular_ruler: :chart_with_upwards_trend: :mountain_railway: :earth_americas: &nbsp; &nbsp;  Hello, welcome. I'm Harold Alfred Haugen 

Since 2019, I’ve been bridging my extensive background in **financial services risk and audit leadership** with coded workflows, algorithmic design, and machine learning, finding practical scenarios to apply **ML and AI** in solving complex, real-world problems. I recently completed my **M.S. in Data Science** at the University of Virginia’s School of Data Science (Summer 2025), building on prior machine learning studies at **Georgetown University** in 2020. 

My experience spans statistical modeling from linear and non-linear techniques to deep learning architectures, with applications of Bayesian inference to derive posteriors across feature variables and latent constructs.

This ReadMe will share my recent focus and interest on **data structurem design, feature engineering and importance analysis, outlier recognition, associational coefficient analysis, as well as predictive inference**. My recent projects have applied these methods to challenges in **visual learning** and **healthcare analytics**,
