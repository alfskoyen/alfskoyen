## :milky_way: :triangular_ruler: :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bullettrain_side: :earth_americas: &nbsp;  Hello, I'm Alfred Haugen. Welcome to my Git.

Since 2019, I‚Äôve been bridging my extensive background in **risk and audit leadership across FSI** with coded workflows, algorithmic design, and machine learning, finding practical scenarios to apply **ML and AI** in solving complex, real-world problems. I recently completed my **M.S. in Data Science** at the University of Virginia‚Äôs School of Data Science (Summer 2025), building on prior machine learning studies at **Georgetown University** in 2020. 

My experience spans statistical modeling from linear and non-linear techniques to deep learning architectures, with applications of Bayesian inference to derive posteriors across feature variables and latent constructs.

This ReadMe highlights my focus on **data structure design, feature engineering, importance analysis, outlier detection, associational coefficient analysis, and predictive inference.** Recent projects apply these methods to visual learning and healthcare analytics, using tools like GVIF multicollinearity checks, SHAP interpretability, and cross-validation to build robust, reproducible workflows that turn complex data into practical insights.

## Projects

### [CNN Visual Learning](https://github.com/eltsvetk/DS6050_Project)  
Landslide Detection Through Deep Learning ‚Äî Applied convolutional neural networks with transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning to classify satellite imagery into landslide and non-landslide regions, supporting risk mitigation and disaster management.

### [Scalable Inference with AWS Step Functions and Lambda](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/DS5110_Fall_2024/tree/main/Team%201) 
To support large-scale astronomical modeling, we built a serverless workflow using AWS SageMaker, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and CloudWatch to orchestrate parallel distribution and execution of tasks. Amazon S3 provided a structured data architecture to store segmented training inputs and capture outputs from distributed runs, while Step Functions and Lambda coordinated execution across many workloads. We also developed Python scripts to collect and organize CloudWatch metrics alongside JSON outputs from the parallel runs, enabling calculation of mean performance measures for review and visualization. This design allows complex astronomical computations to scale automatically while providing clear insight into execution flow, runtime performance, and cost efficiency.

### International Clinical Field Studies: Data Research and Regression Insights
This report highlights my work in associational coefficient analysis across historical lower and middle income countries (LMIC) field studies, examining relationships between covariates and outcomes. The project involved extensive data wrangling, cleaning, and research to manage heterogeneous datasets and assess variable interconnectedness. Methods included statistical and machine learning models, multicollinearity diagnostics, and interaction effects to capture nuanced patterns. Emphasis was placed on robust regression pipelines, comparative model evaluation, and reproducible workflows to deliver meaningful clinical insights.

### Predictive Inference in Critical Care: Data Wrangling to Model Evaluation
This project explored whether predictive inference was a valid opportunity for classifying ICU ventilation duration using the **MIMIC-III** dataset. We focused on structuring and wrangling clinical data, engineering features, and training models including logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks. To identify the most informative predictors, we combined multicollinearity analysis (GVIF) with feature importance methods (SHAP, regression diagnostics), supported by cross-validation across iterative models. Emphasis was placed on building reproducible pipelines that link data preparation, feature selection, and predictive modeling to generate insights for ICU decision-making and resource planning. Repository private given patient data protection and research ethics compliance.
