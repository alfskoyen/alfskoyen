## Hello, welcome. :milky_way: :triangular_ruler: :chart_with_upwards_trend: I'm Harold Alfred Haugen

Since 2019, Iâ€™ve been bridging my background in **financial services risk and audit leadership** with coded workflows, algorithmic design, and machine learning, finding practical scenarios to apply **ML and AI** in solving complex, real-world problems. I recently completed my **M.S. in Data Science** at the University of Virginiaâ€™s School of Data Science (Summar 2025), building on prior machine learning studies at **Georgetown University** in 2020. 

I have applied a wide range of **statistical models**, from linear and non-linear approaches to **deep learning neural networks**, as well as **Bayesian statistics** to derive posteriors across feature variables and latent features.  

My current interests focus on **data structures, feature engineering, A/B testing with linear modeling, feature importance analysis, and outlier recognition**. I apply these methods to challenges in **financial services** and **healthcare analytics**, leveraging 20+ years of experience in risk management alongside a strong foundation in data science and machine learning.  



My ReadMe will share my recent experiences in **data structures, feature engineering, A/B testing with linear modeling, feature importance analysis, and outlier recognition**. I apply these methods to challenges in **financial services** and **healthcare analytics**, leveraging 20+ years of experience in risk management alongside a Masterâ€™s in Data Science from UVA.
